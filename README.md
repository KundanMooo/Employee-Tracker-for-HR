# Employee-Tracker-for-HR


## Project Description:
The project demanded to evaluate employees data for the HR department and produce a finished dashboard. 
This investigation includes patterns linked to employee attendance in the office, work-from-home trends, and sick leave patterns within the organisation. 
By gathering insights from this study, the HR department may plan future programs, optimize team sizes for forthcoming projects,
and even organize vaccination campaigns based on sick leave data. This data-driven strategy not only boosts productivity and
project planning but also considerably decreases HR workload, saving around 4 hours of labour.

## Insights from the Project:
1) Presence Trend: Analyzing the presence trend over time can help discover trends, such as peak seasons or periods of low staff attendance, enabling optimal resource allocation and project planning.
2) Work-from-Home Trend: Studying the work-from-home trend can give insights into the viability and demand of remote work solutions. It may influence choices on establishing remote work policies, optimizing office space, and boosting employee happiness.
3) Sick Leave Trend: Analyzing the sick leave trend helps detect any repeating trends, such as certain days or seasons when sick leaves are more prevalent. This information may be utilised to plan for proper workforce coverage, execute health programmes, and identify possible health concerns within the firm.
4) Sick Leave Trend by Weekdays: Identifying certain weekdays with greater sick leave rates can help plan task distribution and organise crucial events or meetings on days when more employees are likely to be present.
5) Work-from-Home Trend by Weekdays: Understanding which weekdays have higher work-from-home rates may help improve project deadlines, scheduling, and team coordination by aligning tasks that demand greater in-office presence on days when more employees are accessible remotely.
