# Employee-Tracker-for-HR
Our project analyzes work patterns, including work from home, employee presence, and sick leave trends within the company. 
These insights enable us to plan future projects, optimize team sizes, and predict employee availability. Additionally,
we implement initiatives based on employee sickness trends. This data-driven approach not only enhances productivity and
project planning but also reduces daily HR workload by 3 to 4 hours.
